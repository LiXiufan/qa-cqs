This repository contains the simulation programs of the near-term quantum algorithms based on the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). The algorithm was originally proposed by Hsin-Yuan Huang, et. al. in the article [arXiv:1909.07344]. For feedback, please contact Xiufan at e1117166@u.nus.edu.
